#Postfix: Postfix is a Open source mail transfer agent (MTA), an application used to send and receive email.
if you are managing a cloud server on which you have installed applications that need to send
email notifications, running a local, send-only SMTP server is a good alternative 
to using a 3rd party email service provider or running a full-blown SMTP server.

#postfix/smtpd - This is typically the SMTP daemon process for handling incoming mail 
and routing to the appropriate internal location.

#postfix/smtp - This is typically the SMTP daemon process for delivering mail out to the world.
If you're seeing alot of postfix/smtp log entries, these would be all of the SMTP connections
sending spam out to other nodes.


"Deferred" means that Postfix tried to deliver the message but failed 
(in this case because the MX server rejected the SMTP connection), and
 so it is going to wait a while and try to deliver it later
