    drwxrwxr-x => read, write and execute permissions for root, current user and group 
 
3.#creating files and Directory
    create files
    1.touch filename1 filename2 filename3 => create an empty File or list of files
    2. cp sourcefile destinationfile => copy a file 
    3. vi filename=> editor  if file not exist it will create new file 
    create directory:
    1. mkdir directoryName : make directory
    2. mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3 : create multiple directories

4.# 7 Types of files in linux:
   File Symbol           Meaning
       -                 Regular file
       d                 Directory
       l                 links
       c                 special file or device file:like attached keyboard file
       s                 socket
       p                 named pipe
       b                 block device
5.#find files and directories
   1.find:
      find . -name filename => find the file starting from the current directory(.)
      find / -name ifcfg-enp0s3 => starting from root(/) dir using root user find network file
        if permission denied for directory then can't search so use su - or sudo -s
   2.locate:
     for locate: sudo yum install mlocate
                  sudo updatedb
     locate filename  => find the file with locate
6.# difference between find and locate
    1.locate command uses a prebuilt database which should be regularly updated(command => sudo updatedb)
    2.find iterate over filesystem to locate files does not have database.
    thus locate is much faster than find but can be inacurate if the database is not
    updated
