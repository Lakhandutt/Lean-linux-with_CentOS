# link = shortcut on windows
#inode: Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
#soft link : link will be removed if file is removed or rename
#hard link : deleting renaming and moving original file will not affect the hard link

#command: $ ln (by default hard link)
          $ ln -s  (for softlink)

#example soft link:
$ touch hulk
$ ln -s /hulk
$ ls -ltr  => lrwxrwxrwx 1 vagrant vagrant  5 Jan  3 20:03 hulk -> /hulk => l for link in begining
$ cd into file directory and vi hulk and edit file
$ ls -il => i means inode number
$ inode for file and soft link are different
# remove the source file and try to open the link => cat: hulk: No such file or directory
# so link is not usable now remove it also

#example hard link
#create a file again and content in it and create a hard link for it
$ ln /hulk
# no pointing to other file and same content as the file
# inode for file and hard link are same
# if you modify the source file it modify destination also
# if you remove the source file then the link will still exist and content of the file also exist due to inode
