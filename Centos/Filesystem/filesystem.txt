1. Linux file system
commands file: /usr/bin
attached devices: /dev
applications: /etc  or /var

2. Linux -ext3,ext4,xfs  

3. folders in linux:
/boot-contains files that is used by boot loader (grub.cfg)
/root- root user home directory but not same as /:- root
/dev- system devices
/etc- configuration files( dns, NTP,send mail) for all services
/bin -> /usr/bin- everyday user command-like ls, pwd
/sbin -> /usr/sbin- system/filesystem commands - extend file system
/opt- optional add-on applications (not part of OS apps)-third party
/proc-files os running process (only exist in memory)-empty on shutdown
/lib-> usr/lib - c programming library files needed by commands and apps.
             command: strace -e open pwd : used to see which c/c++ library used for pwd command
/tmp: directory for temporary files
/home: directory for user
/var: system logs-find info about specific applications
/run: system daemons that start very early(systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files
        like PID files
/mnt: to mount external filesystem(e.g NFS)
/media: for cdrom mounts

4. Navigating file system:
    cd-change directory (cd .. => one directory back) (only cd =>switch to current user home directory)
    pwd-print working directory
    ls- listing  (ls -l: long listing all details)=> -rwxr-xr-x =>start with - means file and
                                                     drwxr-xr-x =>start with d means directory
                                                     lrwxrwxrwx => start with l means link
    ls -ltr => long list file sort according to time in reverse order (oldest one on the top)
